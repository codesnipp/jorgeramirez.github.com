I am **_Jorge Ram√≠rez_** from Villa Elisa, Paraguay. I am majoring in Computer Science Engineering at 
[FP-UNA](http://www.pol.una.py).

Here in my personal website you will find the Open Source Projects I have built, and also my blog
into which I will be posting updates about my projects, new projects I could come up with, and anything
related about Web Development and Computer Science in general (mainly webdev =P).
