I am _Jorge Ram√≠rez_ from Villa Elisa Paraguay. I am majoring in computer science engineering at UNA.

In this blog I will be writing down whatever I am currently working on or learning about, that is, 
anything related to programming, open source, etc.

Currently I am focusing on web development because I want to learn as much as possible about 
anything related to client-side/server-side scripting.

I will be posting here whenever I have some time to do it.
